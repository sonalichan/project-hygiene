                <p>Hygiene is a basic human necessity and a human right. Keeping public, as well as personal, hygiene up
                    to standards is critical to maintain the health of a city or population.
                    This requires a city like Seattle, which includes a large homeless population, to require enough
                    public hygiene stations for those who need it.
                    According to Seattle Magazine, a lack of 24-hour public restrooms downtown contributes to sanitation
                    hazards and the spreading of diseases.
                    As of January 1st 2019, Seattle had cut funding for hygiene centers downtown, leaving the homeless
                    to relieve themselves wherever and whenever they can.
                    As allocating funding and continuing the upkeep of public restrooms has previously failed in
                    Seattle, city council members have made an effort to position restroom inaccessibility as a general
                    public health issue,
                    and not just one pertaining to our unsheltered population.
                    Ballard has implemented one portable restroom, while the University Districtâ€™s attempt is hindered
                    by disagreeable maintenance fees. So, as Seattle slowly makes advances to attempt to fix this issue,
                    we hope to help sheltered and unsheltered populations alike find alternatives close to where they
                    are.</p>

                <h3 id="planning">What we plan to do</h3>
                <p>
                    The current map
                    map above does not have the ability to zoom in and out, and lacks basic details. It is complex and
                    does
                    not
                    have enough affordances to make it clear how it's supposed to be used. We also plan on adding a
                    feature
                    called "add a bathroom", that will allow users to add a bathroom to the current list.

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>We plan on focusing on this issue and creating a solution that will allow anyone to get access to the
                    nearest restroom that is open to public, free or paid. At the moment, the city of Seattle has
                    somewhat of an interactive map,
                    but it is geared towards the homeless and lackluster in design and function. Our idea is to cater
                    towards all citizens and create an interactive map that shows the locations of the nearest
                    restrooms, laundry, showers, etc. including ones in restaurants and stores.
                    After a certain period (TBD), we will ask the user to submit feedback on whether the restroom was
                    accessible, free, clean, had a child station, etc. This information will be stored to improve the
                    experience for people planning to use this tool in the future.
